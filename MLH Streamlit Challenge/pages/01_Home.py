# Project overview paragraph
st.write("As a soon to graduate computer science students participating in ShellHacks 2024, our motive for creating a \
   Streamlit website that uses machine learning to forecast water quality stems from the desire to tackle a pressing global\
    issueâ€”access to clean water. Water quality is crucial for public health, environmental sustainability, and economic development,\
     yet many communities around the world face challenges in monitoring and managing this resource effectively.")

st.write("We want to leverage technology to address real-world problems, and water quality monitoring is an essential\
    aspect of environmental and public health. By building a system that can predict potential water contamination or\
     detect changes in quality, this team aims to provide an accessible tool for communities, researchers, and\
      policymakers to take proactive action in ensuring clean water supply. ")

st.write("This hackathon offers the perfect opportunity to experiment with machine learning models in a meaningful\
    context. By analyzing water quality data (such as pH levels, dissolved oxygen, contaminants, etc.), we can create\
     a model that predicts future trends based on historical patterns and real-time inputs. This also allows us to apply\
      our knowledge of data science and machine learning to a practical and socially relevant problem.")

    By using Streamlit, we can present complex data and predictions in a user-friendly interface, making the water quality\
     forecast tool accessible to a wide range of users, from government agencies to local communities or even individuals \
     concerned about their water supply.")
